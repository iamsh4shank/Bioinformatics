## Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. It involves the integration of computers, software tools, and databases in an effort to address biological questions.

Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental molecular biology, bioinformatics techniques such as image and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the textual mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation.

This repo contains the code related to the task given in the course [*Finding hidden mesages in DNA (Bioinformatics 1)*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis). It helps us to tackle various problems ralated to replication origin located in a DNA sequence or Genome. 
- [Week 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis/home/week/1) -> Where in the Genome Does DNA Replication Begin? In this week week it will discuss the algorithms like counting the pattern, frequent kmer, mismatches, pattern to number, and number to pattern.
- [Week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis/home/week/2) -> This week it will discuss about hamming distance, neighbours, skew, approximation pattern matching, and mismatched word with no reverse.
- [Week 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis/home/week/3) -> Which DNA Patterns Play the Role of Molecular Clocks? In these two week it will discuss the algorithms related to motif finding by various methods like motif search, median string, entropy, motif enumeration, motif enumeration by brute force. 
- [Week 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis/home/week/4) -> This week it will discuss about other methods for finding motifs with the hlep of gibbs sampler and randomized motif search.
- [Week 5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis/home/week/5) -> It will consist of a Bioinformatics Application Challenge in which you will get to apply software for finding DNA motifs to a real biological dataset.
